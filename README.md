 # the key points that every developer must master:
 
# 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

- the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are, But the code should be simple and clear so that everyone can understand it and know its purpose

# 2. The Goals of Software Design

 - You should focus on additional functionality

 - The design of the program is to make the work of developers as easy as possible up to two years of focusing on the important things

 # 3. (Mis)understanding

 - one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

# 4. Simplicity

 - The process of reducing complexity to simplicity

 - Writing should make it easier to eliminate mistakes

# 5. Complexity

 - Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

 - The source of many software failures is complexity

# 6. Maintenance

- to reduce the effort of implementation.

- All changes require maintenance.

- Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance.

- The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces.

-  The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software.

# 7. Consistency

Consistency is a big part of simplicity

 - Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand.

# 8. Prioritizing

- there are three important factors that will help you make a better decision:

- The desirability of a change (D)

- The value of a change (V)

- The effort required to perform the change (E)

- The equation is simple


# 9. Solving Problems

- The first step is understanding. 

- The second step is planning

- The third step is dividing

# 10. Good enough is fine

- The incremental design should be your guide. Here is how you would use it to design a calculator:

1- Plan a system that does only addition and nothing else.

2- Implement it.

3- Improve the now-existing system’s design so you can add other operations also.

4- Plan subtraction and repeat step 2 and 3.

5- Plan multiplication and repeat step 2 and 3.

6- Plan division and repeat step 2 and 3.


# 11. Predictions

- A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future.

- You can’t predict the future, so no matter how generic your solution is, it will not be generic enough to satisfy the actual future requirements you will have

- Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.

# 12. Assumptions

- An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof

- Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. —  Code Simplicity

# 13. Stop Reinventing

-The only times it’s okay to reinvent the wheel is when any of the following are true:

1- You need something that doesn’t exist yet

2- All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs

3- The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained

Simple rule:

Don’t reinvent the wheel.

# 14. Resistance

- Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.

# 15. Automation

- If you can automate it, automate it.

- Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks

# 16. Code measurement

- Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.

- The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

# 17. Productivity

- Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible.

# 18. Testing

- You should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time

- Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

# 19. (Under)Estimation

 - the underestimation leads to missing deadlines.

- Everything takes longer than you think.

# 20. Running Away From Rewriting

-Refactoring should be the first option.

# 21. Documentation and Commenting

- Another thing is documenting. It is important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture and every module and components. 

-This is required to see the high-level picture of your software.

# 22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)

- Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.

- When you are dependent so much on external technologies, you are not free.

# 23. Self-Development

- Be open-minded

- Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.

# 24. Don’t be a hero

 - A lot of times it’s better to be a quitter than a hero

-  Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

# 25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help

- When you have something to implement and you are not sure about the solutions, don’t ask others how to so it 

- When you can’t think of anything on your own, search!
